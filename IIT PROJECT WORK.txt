codes for the LDPC-2020 project work-------

[-50:0.001:50];

--> y=sin(2*%pi*5*t);

--> plot(t,y)
IT IS TAKEN FOR NORMAL TIME, LIKE THIS YOU CAN GET FOR NQUIST AND SAMPLED TIME


QUESTION ARISES HOW TO FIND THE FREQUENCY OF SINE CURVE?

 IN THIS PROJECT, I HAVE USED fft() FUNCTION FAST FURIER SERIES FUNCTION

 =[-50:0.0001:50];

--> y=sin(2*%pi*500*t);

--> F=fft(y);

--> F_abs= abs(F);

--> plot(F_abs)

HERE ABOVE IS THE EXAMPLE OF FINDING FREQUENCY BY fft() FUNCTION HERE I HAVE TAKEN ABSOLUTE VALUE BECASUE fft() FUNCTIONIS COMPLEX IN NATURE.
